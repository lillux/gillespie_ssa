# Gillespie Stochastic Simulation Algorithm

Implementation of Gillespie Stochastic Simulation Algorithm

## Installation

The `gillespie` package can be installed with:
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/lillux/gillespie_ssa.git@main#egg=gillespie
```

## Usage

The [link](https://github.com/lillux/gillespie_ssa/blob/main/gillespie.ipynb) contains a jupyter-notebook, that shows how to perform a Stochastic Simulation using the `gillespie` library.

The example includes the bi-stable *Schlogl model*, and how to visualize it.
